# iss_tracking
Python nternational Space Station (ISS) Tracking project in Python. Dez, 2022. Based on: Angela Yu 

## Can I track the ISS from my location?
Image result for this code will track the iss in the sky, comparing to your location and time.
The space station can be seen from over 6,700 locations worldwide. Enter your location to find out
when the space station will be flying overhead.
## Is the ISS visible every night?
It can only be seen when it is dawn or dusk at your location.
As such, it can range from one sighting opportunity a month to several a week,
since it has to be both dark where you are, and the space station has to happen to be going overhead.
